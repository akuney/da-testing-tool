Outline of README:

-People need a new ruby (brew install ruby)
and put it in their path (insert line from bash profile)

-People need to not be using JRuby if that's relevant
-People probably need to install the relevant gems
(unless I include a gemfile?)
-After that, they can just put in their example.
