"KAYAK partnership update meeting - 3/14/14

Attendees: 
Ingrid Michelson
Carolyn, Noreen


Summary takeaways:

The good
They love our pop-unders and we’re seen as locked in there
The want to expand our footprint as much as possible, including:
iPad
UK
Multi-product exit units
Show Hotel / Flights to Car and Package shoppers
They are interested in Cars and Packaging when we launch (but volumes are tiny)
They are interested in Cars and Packaging when we launch (but volumes are tiny)
They are very interested in ideas on how we can backfill when they have poor liquidity
This is very consistent with the feedback from TA
But… it seems like they’ve hacked together an ad serving system with very little control around decisioning 
Ingrid runs their audience monetization and is actively interested in discussing  how we could partner

The bad
Ingrid doesn’t seem to be a decision maker or actually know how decisions do get made
Giorgos continues to be the key guy (from what I can tell)
Our SRP test was not successful
We drove ~$5 net eCPM
They see $30-35 net eCPM on the home grown products (if we can take Ingrid at face value)
The Sales team HATED it - they cheered when they announced they were shutting it off
We may have an opportunity to re-test, but likely not on full traffic
Potential to target paid traffic only - they have a current initiative to get more aggressive for this slice (“to whore up our landing pages”)
Potential to target long tail (<20 markets), which is apparently 90% of traffic
Neither seemed likely
The Front door iFC test is very unlikely - again, major conflict with direct sales team efforts
Further, Ingrid thinks that the CPCs are equally strong on home page vs on page placements on their side
She had no update on Mobile timing (however, it seems that they lost several Mobile engineers, hence the delay)

Actions:
CSS to send follow ups
Confirm mobile launch timing
Confirm traffic mix (tablets and split by product)
Send updates multi-tab XU mockups
Evaluate adding XUs to other product paths
CSS to provide intro for Josh on audience monetization

Other context:
KAYAK priorities
Apparently, 4 months ago (with the Chrome / Safari 6.1 releases), KAYAK had a massive panic, took multi-click and pop-unders out of their plan for the year
This was when Giorgos came to use and asked what creative ideas we had and initiated the test
Since then, they’ve found 2 great solutions (Click Tabs and interstitials) and have had a nice windfall in revenues - so frankly we’re just not as critical right now
Direct sales conflict
We got a lot more context on the Sales pressures
They have no interest in giving up direct relationships
The Sales team definitely feels like we’re encroaching on their turf
We are not currently considering outsourcing any big components of their Compare vs. KAYAK program
KAYAK org
Ingrid reports to Kristina who runs global sales and who reports into Keith
It’s pretty clear that Product is driving in our relationship
Ingrid is kind and collaborative, but still seems out of the loop on what we are doing and why
She openly admitted that she needs to start working directly with Giorgos (she’s been working through Kristen, which hasn’t been effective)
In the meantime, reinforced for me that Giorgos is calling the shots and that he’s who we need to sell
Rough traffic mix data
Flights - 2.5-3MM queries per day
Hotels - 300-400K queries per day
Cars - 100K gueries per day
Packages - 40-50K queries per day
She thinks they see 2-3 page views per queries
I don’t trust this at all…
Decisioning
KAYAK currently shows much more aggressive display advertising for the long tail (and it’s doing really well for them)
They define long tail as anything other than Top 20 markets (roughly 90% of traffic)
She’d love to see if there’s a differentiated approach that makes sense, but they seem to have very limited functionality in current systems
I talked through segmentation (which she remembered from her Expedia days), but it didn’t seem like a near term fit
On page test
She agreed the results were confusing
She thinks it’s possible that there could have been a bug that was double counting impressions on their side (though I’m skeptical that this would have impacted us)
Apparently we are not even in the ball park - she thinks they see $30-35 eCPM from the corresponding Compare placements that they run
I still can’t get my head around how we could be so far off...
Mobile
She had no context still (despite being copied on 4 requests for more intel)
Apparently, a couple Mobile engineers left recently (potential driver for the delay)
3rd party retargeting	
This is the one thing Ingrid actually owns and gets and needs
I’m actually optimistic about our ability to progress this, if we want to
We didn’t get into the details, but she definitely wants to juice display media campaigns
SSN for KAYAK
Interest was piqued in long tail liquidity that we could offer
That said, the Aria ad (and others like it) are home grown, direct sold ads
She wasn’t in a position to share any performance data, but it didn’t seem like SSN was going to be a priority

"Latest design recommendation from KAYAK attached below. 

My sense here it that we should keep this simple and just go with what they want - through feel free to tweak any specific issues in the design.  Then once it’s up, we can pitch optimizations (color, headline, etc).

One specific question, do we have ability to keep the multi-click button grey, then add color once a user checks any of our advertisers? I feel like that would be helpful in this context.

Any other major flaws in the design that we should point out to them? Looks like this test is coming in mid-Aug, so we have time...?",Carolyn Starrett,3892217,Deal,KAYAK - SCA - Flight - OP - List Page Backfill,2014-07-18T17:13:12Z,18238914,,,,2014-07-18T17:15:04Z

"7/29/2014 -- NDA - Tim approved and I sent to Groupon for countersignatures.  See notes below from Tim:

""I  reviewed their NDA and it is pretty good actually.  The only part of it that I don’t really like is the indemnity in Section 4.  However that indemnity only applies to third party claims against Groupon arising from breaches by your representatives of the NDA.  You don’t have any corporate affiliates so this really applies to breaches by your employees/officers/directors and your outside advisors, which seems unlikely to happen.  And it only applies to third party claims against Groupon arising from those breaches, which also seems unlikely to occur given the nature of the information being disclosed.  Taken together, I think it is a reasonable risk to accept that language and sign the agreement as-is.  This is good because the agreement was sent in a form that is unable to be modified!

Ad Unit Sizes -- you asked about accommodating the current ad units your have on your site today, ie. 300x250, 160x600, 720 footer, etc.  In general, we should be able to accommodate whatever size ad you need.  Our design team will work with yours to come up with various design options to conduct Multi-Variant Testing on.  As far as integrating the ads on your site, it is a fairly easy process that just requires a single java tag  Most of our publisher complete the work in a matter of hours.

Limiting Advertisers Based on Traffic Source - you had raised a concerned about recirculating user.  Ie they just came from a site like Oribitz thru a SkyScanner Ad… you don't want to show the user Orbitz in Search Compare Ad and recirculate them back to where they came.  Today we do track if the user came from another Intent Media Ad running on another site and do block that advertiser from showing.  So for example if you are advertising with us and show up in a Search Compare ad on Expedia, then when the user comes to your site from that ad, Expedia will be blocked from being displayed in the Search Compare ad on your site so they are note recirculated.",Noreen Henry,64266119,SalesAccount,,2014-08-04T18:34:03Z,20897172,,,,2014-08-04T18:34:03Z

"8/14/2014 MOCK UP/USE CASE DEEP DIVE at PPA meeting.    Brief summary:
- We are concerned Advertisers will not be supportive of the Dealbase use case as it puts their standard pricing at a disadvantage and there's not much incentive to advertise.
- Next step is to discuss high level use cases with Advertisers (b.com and pcln) and see if we can also get access to the special rates.
- Other options could be to give Dealbase an ""average price"" to compare against -- we would need to charge for this.
- Noreen to let Dealbase know we are working on this and expect to comeback in 2 weeks with some direction",Noreen Henry,64266085,SalesAccount,,2014-08-14T18:45:04Z,21396596,Dealbase,,,2014-08-14T18:45:04Z

"8/18/2014 CALL W/ ROGER --re ShermansTravel, and learned a few things: 
- White Label version - if a customer needs hotel content (photos, descriptions, etc.) they only offer a ""White Label"" solution.  They can't offer an API solution as they don't own the content and don't have the right to license it.  So for ShermansTravel, for example the only option is White label.
- API - Their API solution only provides meta pricing, and Intent Media is 1 of 6 different meta feeds they have. 

QUESTIONS SENT TO RH:  
- IM exclusivity -- is there any exclusivity for us as part of their White Label solution?  At a minimum, if we have the lead and bring them in (i.e. ShermansTravel), I would think we would be the exclusive provider of prices.
- API Inclusion/exclusion - I didn't realize beforehand that I could be competing against them on deals that only require meta pricing and that their offer includes our feed along with 5 others.  If I'm actually competing against them, do we have the right to force them to exclude us from their API?",Noreen Henry,64266113,SalesAccount,,2014-08-18T19:04:17Z,21673185,,,,2014-08-18T19:04:17Z

- Adv concerns:  Dan provided clarifying info on ""deal types"" and UI adjustments they will make to ""restricted rates""
- Rev Share:  add'l pushback on our rev/share amount similar to ""ShareTrips"".  Given ShareTrips is moving to BB/Trip - I'm concerns that BB is getting more aggressive on rev share terms for PPA.

"INTEL ON TIMING FOR PPA PHANTOM / FAKE CARDS:
(From David White)

Yesterday, I spoke to Alan Josephs about the concept we discussed in MV, “phantom cards” where Travelzoo has editorial content but no directly sold price.  Alan told me that he was already working to hire editors to create phantom cards because he was very close to signing a deal with a 3rd party to get one price for hotels where we have no direct relationship.  He was enthusiastic about PPA for this case as a great way to offer better prices to the user and increase monetization.  But, it won’t speed up the work of creating the phantom cards because Alan was already working on this as a matter of urgency.

"INTEL FROM ROOM 77 CALL
Full Email: ""Travelzoo Intel from Room 77 Call""

Some intel about Travelzoo from the Room 77 call with Roger below. Don't know if it's news, but wanted to share. 
-Room 77 directly asked us about value per click from Travelzoo
-We gave broad TPs on keeping an eye on click value across our network
-We didn't share any information on Travelzoo value being different (we don't have visibility into Fly.com Hotel traffic anyway)

We then inquired as to why Roger was asking
-It turns out that one of main the reasons Travelzoo is no longer working with KAYAK is KAYAK smart priced them
-KAYAK ran a study to understand click value
-That study showed that Travelzoo clicks were less valuable
-Based on that study KAYAK took price adjustment measures
-Travelzoo reportedly doesn't believe that study (and is upset enough about the change to have it catalyze looking for a new provider)",Lynne Hamilton,64266126,SalesAccount,,2014-08-01T22:25:11Z,20661253,,,,2014-08-01T22:25:11Z

"TECHNICAL CALL:

Takeaways:
 - They confirmed using Tagman for JS
 - Odigeo wants to start test 50/50 (control vs. traffic with IM model)
 -- They will make that split (we'll have insight into it via show_ads)
 - They want to understand High Value / Low Value split (in addition to control vs. non)
 - They are having a hard time selling putting our DIV hardcoded on the page (Artem / Maria feel pretty confident they can push it through, though)

Action Items:
 - AW / LH: To send TPs on:
 -- Why hardcoding DIV on page is the best approach
 -- Segmentation / Measurement methodology (why measuring whole group more important than HV and LV separate;y)
 -- Why there's no performance concern on trafficking JS in show_ads = no (and why we need it)

 - AW: Validate / verify an communicate:
 -- Parameters they can pass are okay (e.g., o/m for oneway, multicity, promo code, device type etc.)
 -- If / how we could send them information on High Value / Low Value designation and how much extra work it will be

AW: Schedule another call


Agenda:
 - Confirm test plan A/B splits.
 - Confirm how IM tag and DIV will be inserted into the page (tag via TagMan; DIV directly in page, or via DCLK?).
 - Finalize the list of available/permissible parameters.
 - Odigeo to share with IM how they plan to run the A/B test to populate show_ads = 'Y' or 'N' (e.g. using MVT platform, or other method?).
 - For the IM show_ads='Y' bucket, 25% of users will still not see ads as they will be in the IM 'High Value' segment - Odigeo mentioned wishing to have that fact reported back to them. Need to  clarify why this is needed - we think Odigeo would be best off simply comparing the 2 buckets overall (not getting into the 'did or did not see ads' level specifically within the IM traffic bucket).
 - Confirm that, given that 50% of your traffic will definitely not see any IM ads, we agree we do not need a further 'Pure' (control) group within the IM 50% bucket of traffic, since the non-IM 50% bucket traffic share will already serve as the control group.
 - Next steps and timings.",Lynne Hamilton,64266088,SalesAccount,,2014-08-07T14:58:10Z,21010119,eDreams Odigeo,,,2014-08-07T15:47:39Z

ACTION ITEMS
SCA
 - Details Page XU
 -- Angus: Send integration documentation
 - Top 20 Market IDs 
 -- Adrian: Send top 20 market IDs (so we can ensure we can render on bulk of markets)

PPA
 - Property fill rate
 -- Adrian: Send enhanced version (ASAP); Send even better version ~ WO 18 Aug
 - Request errors from Property ID changes
 -- Lynne: Check if we can use the TripAdvisor ID instead for lookup
 - Control group split
 -- John: To look into page view difference and hidden page view issue
 - Creative treatments for inline
 -- Adrian: Send info on what colos (Lynne: Will subsequently do mockups)
 - Conversion reconciliation 
 -- John: Diagnose and resolve conversions without travel dates (2nd priority)

PROPERTY ID GAP (25%)
Best idea for fix
 - lastminute.com doesn't store EAN properties
 -- They've asked if we can change lastminute.com live passed ID to be Trip Advisor ID

 Overview of supply strategy for lastminute.com
 - Focus on Top 83 destination (1. London to 83. Chicago-like cities
 -- Other cities are Barcelona, Dubai, Sydney, etc.
 -- We want to actively market manage for these locations
 -- Have own supply + blend in supply from EAN  = EAN 2
 -- They have property IDs for those EAN properties
 - For other destinations, they're completely outsourcing supply from EAN entirely (they don't have property IDs for those destinations) = EAN 1

TRIP ADVISOR ID QUALITY
 - The best version they could possibly give you
 - They'll send another enhanced version ASAP - then an even better one in 2 weeks

IE11
 - Shared that there's no big update
 -- Messages to David:
 --- ""We've been able to touch base with everyone we needed to here
 --- They're bought in to opportunity
 --- IM next steps are to full scope and prioritize network-wide test
 --- Roadmap is locked and highly competitive, but we're optimistic""
 -- David seemed totally okay, no pushback
 - David inquired about obfuscating code
 -- We stated it was easy to de-obfuscate -- anyone else could, too
 -- He said anything that's good with us is good with him (incentive to have Microsoft not discover it is shared)

Hotel SuperSearch
 - Through Tzoo QA (they didn't find anything)
 - A few desired optimizations post-launch (KZ owns)
 - They'd like to turn it on to 2% this week

Cross Sell
 - Intro David to Ronak
 - Ronak shares what would be needed to be a part of product
 - LH to make introduction

Booking Engine SCA
 - CEO-level visibility
 - Core sell to stakeholders re company future (counteract email business deline)
 - Will have WAY more scrutiny on everything

Booking Engine PPA
 - Getaroom will be 50% private prices -- they'll also be phantom cards
 - Getaroom pricing going live on November
 - 60K searches a month
 - Users do always compare prices before they book
 - Opportunity for IM to figure out to do PPA for private deals
 -- IM 3rd party that does PPA for all private prices
 - Could there be a link that says ""compare on public sites?""

Fly.com iFC
 - Success criteria:
 -- David said rule of thumb is ~50% for CPC
 -- Not hanging on CPCs at the onset
 -- Benefit having full coverage (they haven't always had full coverage)
 - Data reconciliation measures
 - Ramp
 -- All traffic or some markets?
 --- Easy way to do it is random
 --- David understands that getting to liquidity might be easier market-by-market
 --- LH: Stay close to Ad Team and as sales progress, can assess value
 -- Depends on relative vs. native
 --- Start on 2% to make sure reports flow through

"WEEKLY CALL 8/15

Data Reconciliation
 - Found root of page view volume issue (and apparent 70/30 split)
 - Webtrends creates ""fake"" page views while waiting to make a decision
 - Action: Regroup to figure out how to allow IM to know which page views are fake

LMN Measurement
 - Pulling data (Alan)
 -- Size of order values of controls vs. test
 -- Strip price from the confirmation page
 -- Do some statistical analysis on top of that data
 -- Check to see if it's normally distributed
 -- There has not been a statistically significant difference between the mean AOV in the first tow groups
 -- Take it from 7/18 (first day we're sure it's being logged correctly)
 - Analyzing (Adrian)
 -- Use 15.2% retail margin
 -- Add commission?
 -- Convert into pounds

Jonathan explained why we don't look at distribution of AOV
 - In concept this is what we want to measure
 - There's a lot of noise / very high variance 
 -- It's a broad spectrum
 -- Outliers for individual transactions that can influence the distribution for the two different groups

 - For purest signal to noise ratio we use converter rate
 -- Note: Not conversion rate
 - We're done studies on tens of millions of conversions that show that converter rate is the only important metric
 - Drive more quickly to statistical significance

LMN stated that they use conversion rate
 - AOV is a secondary KPI
 - From Alan's perspective, he would be happy to run tests based on conversion rate
 - For this trial, it's crucially important to understand the revenue piece
 - Particularly given the different margins

Question from Adrian:
 - Why does he see daily volatility in conversion rate (between the two group), but no increase in CTR
 - Volume per day in conversions is too low to have any statistically significant read
 - The variance is so high, that you will have highly misleading data
 - Need to wait to have enough data to reduce noise

Next Step: Lynne set up call for Data Science team
 - Include: Angus, Jonathan, Shehzad, Mark W. Alan, John

Adrian - Away for 2 weeks

PPA File Quality and TripAdvisor ID mapping
 - Can't do TripAdvisor IDs - they're not on the page in the same way
 - IDs are stored in a backend system
 - They would need to do work (couldn't get prioritized for 7 weeks) and they're afraid it would slow down the site
 -- LMN does not want to switch to TripAdvisor IDs
 - We have to use LMN in-house ID

Using LMN in-house ID means that we won't be able to to serve EAN 1
 - EAN 1 IDs won't be stored until EOY
 - This will be about 75% of traffic",Lynne Hamilton,64266103,SalesAccount,,2014-08-15T13:54:53Z,21484620,lastminute.com,,,2014-08-15T14:34:53Z

"SCRATCHPAD CALL WITH LEO PURCELL AND GUILLAUME BRIL

KEY TAKEAWAYS
 - Odigeo wanted to create hybrid model (OTA + meta) and so acquired Liligo
 - Odigeo has integrated Liligo as meta provider (technically successful)
 - They are interested in working with IM to do the decisioning as to WHEN to show the meta ads
 - RH repitched other ideas (e.g., Liligo / IM partnership to do Flight meta for other OTAs in addition to Odigeo)
 - Their Meta testing is eDreams France
 -- We'd have to do SCA UK implementation and then get it implemented in France
 - Leo very enthusiastic about this opportunity
 -- From Leo: ""Sounds like the intelligence you can bring is the acceleration we've been looking for.""
 -- Don't want to distract us from what we're doing today

NEXT STEPS
 - Follow up call (get more understanding of how Liligo content is being integrated today and IM can brainstorm how we can add decisioning)

DETAILED NOTES

Leo doesn't have full update on what's going on with SCA
 - Jerome is on vacation
 - Let's dig into opportunity and then get an update from IM on SCA

Liligo acquisition -- wanted to create hybrid 
 - Completed integration and have run some trials
 - Technically it's been sucecssful
 - No negative feedback from Liligo end
 - Proven that technically they can do this, report on it, and look at KPIs
 - They're NOT able to do anything intelligent about when and where to optimize the results
 - What went live is black and white (if they found something via meta, they'd show it)
 - They need a lot more sophistication around WHEN to show meta to be successful

Can IM partner with them to do the decisioning as to WHEN to show meta?

RH shared
 - Haven't launched the ad program on the Odigeo sites
 - Tag implementation blockers and new commercial language
 - Those are conceptually unblocked, need to get signatures and tags up
 - When we are live:
 -- There will be tags on the page (in strict confidentiality with what's on the page)
 -- We will create segmentation model and only show ads to Low value users
 - We will be set up to do the decisioning on for High Value / Low Value with current product
 - Separately we've built PPA for US / UK for HOTELS

O: What information are you collecting to make decisions?
 - RH: Four big buckets (how user got to site, users in-path behavior, users past history, products looking at and net value -- for Odigeo index value)
 - RH: Come up with real-time score and update that with every action they take on the site
 - RH: Confirmed it was cookie-based (dependent on the device)

O: How do you monetize that product?
 - RH: We also look at how much media $$ this is worth (we run an auction)

Leo:
 - CPC revenue are fixed by IO by end merchant so for Liligo (there would be less variability in value)

Previous conversations with Liligo:
 - Could we be backend auction for Liligo's meta? (Extract more value)
 -- Leo confirmed that we can set a floor
 -- Leo: IM would need some intel on users propensity to buy to set a floor
 - Could we have a distributed service together, where in addition to doing this for Odigeo alone -- we bundle Liligo's access to pricing with IM technology to offer to other OTAs
 -- RH: these might be farther off, but discussions we've had

O (Guillaume): What's the most efficient way to do this?
 - IM pushes HV / LV to Odigeo or should Liligo push feed to IM
 - RH: Suspect the latter, but we can discuss if we decide to go down this pass
 - RH: We would want to test different things

O (Guil): How quickly can we grab all of these four sources of data and compute score?
 - RH: Revenue index is very simple look up table
 - RH: In general, we can do all of the decisioning and render and ad in under 100ms

O (Leo): You won't know value of customer on first search?
 - RH: Yes, but we update on every page view - so once they select a flight / carrier, we can update it then

RH: Modeling is what we do ALL DAY LONG

O (Leo):
 - Liligo integration is in France
 - UK market (meta content) not strong enough
 - They'd have to have UK (SCA model) done and then get it in place for France
 - LH confirmed France is next market (work on roadmap and scoped)

O (Guil): How good is data quality?
 - Odigeo has found that accuracy of data is huge indicator of success
 - RH: We have great data quality in PPA, but we haven't worked with third party (like Liligo)
 - The architecture very open and we can ingest any signal available on the page --  we can uphold any quality they can pass to us

Evaluate again post fill-rate

David is doing

 - LH asked that David look into CTR (and if we're out-performing as strongly as we are in flight)

David thinks DTA needed to really ramp
 - CTR is inline with expectations (don't think there's a lot of optimization there)

 - Font size: Why is it taking so long? (Test got mucked up with reporting issues we dealt with a few weeks ago.)
 - AI: Karin to add date when things are moved to 100%

Concerns
 During animation scroll bar deforms for a few seconds (you can scroll way way far to the right)
 -- KZ: To follow up (while doing other animation investigations)
What about destination in search form headline?
 -- We spoke with PM and lead engineer (they're looking into it)
 -- Travelzoo reiterated that this is very important for SEM and that they'll turn off their suboptimal headline if we can do it

Potential tests
 - No animation (KZ: To follow up on if we have attribute to test this)

Changing traffic % and speeding up testing
 - How do know how long to run test?
 -- A: We have minimum sample size (based on expected delta) and a confidence interval (95-99%)
 - Can we lower the confidence interval (80-90%)?
 -- Since deltas are small, we've kept it to 95-99%
 -- KZ: Will follow up on (i) if we'll still have reliable results and (ii) how much speed we'll pick up
 - What % of traffic is from repeat visitors (within test window)?
 -- KZ:  Will follow up

FLY IFC
Tech work
 - Firefox ad rendering already deployed and ready
 - Chrome, IE, desktop Safari are ready for QA
 - iPads should be started this week
 -- We will be trafficked on iPads (even though XU are not)

Starting with a single pre-check to optimize for speed to launch
 - 1 prechecks on a page is something we will build / test post launch
 - And, I spoke with devs this morning and we are gonna try to keep Fly Home Page XU active since it seems doable after all

Advertisers
 - We have thin layer
 - Can launch
 - Expect volatility
 - Keeping the same auction floor - TBD if it holds

Payment statement questions
 - Can we send aging report (David sending formal email request)?
 - Was lower than 30% initial payment due to delinquency? (no)
 - Do we keep new advertisers on tighter terms? TraveBuddy24.7 (Yes)

1) Mobile app traffic volume is a fraction of mobile web volume (i.e., lower media opportunity with current CPC)

Subject:  Re: Orbitz True North Update 

+ Lynne

Hey guys,

Carolyn and I just got off the phone with Chris Stevens on the ebookers measurement results. Chris wants to 1) put a model in; 2) conclude the test and ramp. This is basically the best possible outcome! (Kudos to Carolyn for artfully guiding him to this conclusion on his own). 

Chris: “Segmentation is a good story to sell internally. At ebookers' volume, the model might not be as reliable or add much value, but I still want it.”

Next steps:

1) Shehzad to implement the model, but do not remove the pure group yet—we need to notify Chris before the actual ramping
2) Carolyn to notify Chris when model is ready, and package results for him to circulate with ebookers
Lynne - Chris will communicate the measurement results + ramp plan to ebookers; no action required from you
3) Once we have the green light from Chris, Shehzad to remove pure group (Chris is pretty confident that we can ramp within 24-48 hours after he relates the result to ebookers)

Let me know if you have any questions!

Suny,
Was nice to chat with you today. We're looking forward to adding AirTkt.com into our partner network.

Based on our conversation earlier today here are the following steps before we can complete launch:

1) Choose Location for Rail and Intercard Placements

Rail Placement: based on your new interface we recommend that our Rail Ad Unit is positioned above the ""Change Flight Search"" search box.  This will allow consumers to see it as they scroll down but it will not impact the overall design.   

Intercard Placement: From our experience the higher Intercard placement the greater the interaction rate.  Based on the Rail placement above we recommend that the Intercard be placed after the first two listings on the search result page.  This should give the Intercard some distance from the Rail placement and attract a different set of eyeballs.  

Attached are mock-ups of both recommended placements.  

Once a decision is made on placement the tech requirements are relatively straightforward:

2) Migrate IM Tag and Divs to Production
Amit had actually completed all necessary development work to serve ads in your testing environment back in January. For us to start serving ads, we will need your team to migrate our tag and div elements from the test environment to production.

Danny, cc'd, will follow-up tomorrow with updated integration documents.

Please let us know when you are ready for us to turn ads on!

Looking forward to working together on this initiative

"We are still having logo back and forth re. logos on Share Trips.  

High level:
- Share Trips would like to show advertiser logos on ShareTrips existing site - at one they offered to ""take logos off of kayak"" if Intent Media didn't send over logos
- Internal concerns: existing user experience on drop down button is bad; it covers part of below the button ad unit. We are concerned with advertiser blow back if they see their logos being utilized on existing implementation.
- This was communicated to Share Trips (See email below); as a result Share Trips has agreed to remove the drop down button from their site 
- Action item: Intent Media to provide logos to Share Trips

Email (July 24)
Hey Josh,
Thanks for your note. I have had the chance to speak internally on logos and can provide an update. All advertiser logos shown in any Intent Media product require approval (regardless of whether they are being used in an API product or not). The logo sizes you requested would require an entirely new approval process. We would have to go through an approval process regardless of size because we as of yet have not shown logos in any PPA ad unit. Though you are using our API - it is against guidelines to grab logos from Kayak.  

Any advertiser outreach would require us to share screenshots of your current implementation. As mentioned we have concerns with how the Capture the Button drop down works on ShareTrips and would prefer not to cause advertiser blow back by drawing attention to the current UX. Advertiser support of the network is critical to its long term success. 

We understand the desire to include advertiser logos on ShareTrips and I know everyone here is interested in seeing lift associated with logos (it will be a great test and learning opportunity for us!); however, it would be best that we move any logo implementation and testing to your new design.  That gives us 8 weeks to go through a proper approval process. 

I've cc'd Derek Kuhl who is our VP of Advertiser Sales - am happy to organize a call with us if you want to discuss our concerns live. 

Thanks,

"Tara @ Oversee had written us concerned that we had missed payments and generally confused about our payment structure.

Below is email sent back to Tara that outlines how our payment structure works (This email is also saved as a Google Word Doc)

Hi Tara,
I wanted to clarify some of your questions regarding payments to Oversee from Intent Media.  Our goal is to pay publishers 90 days after the close of the month in which the clicks are received.  

This means that we handle payments as follows:

We bill all advertisers at the beginning of the month after advertisements are run. Advertisers are subsequently given a month to pay an invoice.  This means that advertiser payments are due to Intent Media one month after the end of the month in which they were run. We then reconcile payments throughout the month that payments are due. 

We pay our publishers 30 days after the close of the month in which payments are due.  This 30 days is referenced in Section 5a) of our contract; specifically: ""Intent Media shall pay Publisher the percentage of Net Revenues, as set forth in Section 3 of Exhibit A, within (30) days after the end of each calendar month during which Net Revenues are actually received by Intent Media.""

What this means in actuality:
1) For April clicks, advertisers are billed at the beginning of May;
2) Advertiser payments to Intent Media are due at the beginning of June;
3) We reconcile payments throughout the month of June;
4) We then pay publishers on July 30th for April clicks  [The July 2nd email you received from Rudan outlining payment values actually reflected payment for March clicks and should have been sent out on June 30th].

This means that you have actually not received a payment from Intent Media for your April clicks.  According to our Finance Department your April click check (which you will receive at the end of July) should be valued at approximately $7,000; you will receive an email from me on July 30th with specific totals.  This brings your total publisher payment to $24,000 and this matches the ""total expected"" payments per your accrual file if you count clicks and payments from October to end of April.  The end of July check also marks a payment for the 7th month of our partnership (aka payment for clicks made between October and the end of April).  

What I think has confused us both, however, is that we have sent you 7 checks so far and our July 30th check will be the 8the check you've received from us (even though it will be for 7 months of clicks).  The reason for this is a small nuance in our payment system: sometimes we DO receive payments from advertisers before the end of the 30 day payment period.  Because of the way our finance system is set up (as a rolling payment system) we will cut checks to publishers if we receive payment on their behalf during the time period in which it is received. What this means is if we billed a publisher for an October click in early November and they paid us in November, you would have received payment at the end of December.  This is what happened in your situation - you received an $87 payment in December.

Does this help?  Happy to get on the phone to further discuss this afternoon.  I also created the attached excel file which I think should clarify any timelines. 

We can also add this as an agenda item to our meeting which is scheduled for the 28th.  Hope this clears up any confusion. 

Cheers,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hi Eduardo,

Sorry for the confusion.  When we originally launched, it was with the list page exit units only.  We can definitely support the home page exit units, but we're not set up for that as of now.

In order to support the home page exit unit, you will need to set the page_id parameter in the IntentMediaProperties object when the user lands on the home page, and then set the remaining parameters when the user clicks the search button, in addition to calling the fill_ext_unit function.

Once you've completed the remaining work on your end (populating the page_id parameter when the page loads), we can schedule the work on our end to support the home page exit units.

Thanks.

On the home page I have this code when the user clicks on the search button:

if (window.IntentMedia && IntentMedia.fill_exit_unit) {
  IntentMedia.fill_exit_unit();

The problem is that IntentMedia.fill_exit_unit() never gets executed.

Inspecting the ""if"" clause I see that IntentMedia.fill_exit_unit returns undefined. 

Am I missing something?

Hi Ori and Eduardo,

Thank you for the videos and the detailed explanations.

On the home page, the exit unit will only open when you call our fill_exit_unit function.  However, on the list page, we proactively bind to various elements on the page, and we open automatically when the user clicks on one of these elements.  We blacklist elements that the exit unit may interfere with, such as elements that open other pop-up or pop-under windows.

Lastly, I was looking at the data, and it seems that we have not had any ad calls for the exit unit since 7/24.  I looked at the page_id parameter being set on the list page, and it's set to hotel.list_page.  We are looking for the page_id on that page to be set to hotel.list.  Can you modify this parameter and let me know once it's done and I can validate that everything is working correctly?

Please let me know if you have any additional questions about the pop-under methodology.

Thanks!

Hi David,

The problem we were experiencing in the last 3 days was Chrome blocking popup when the user selected one of the providers. the reason was that we were opening a new tab and your script tried to open the popunder at the same time. The pop-under is not supposed to trigger on that event (user selecting one of the room options). It should be triggered on the initial search by inputing dates.

Hi Danny,

I've created two quick videos to demonstrate the problem we are having.

IntentMediaPop - Shows the Intent Media pop-under getting triggered without us calling IntentMedia.fill_exit_unit() anywhere in the codebase (note that I click on the big ""Select"" link)

IntentMediaNoPop - Shows the expected flow without any Intent Media pop-under window (note the click on the small hotel link)

Digging into your JS files that get injected in our site I see this: (Images attached)

IntentMedia.exit_unit_dynamic_blacklist = ["".checkRatesBtn"","".checkRatesList""];
-- this seems to validate why the popup doesn't show when I click on the link that has the class "".checkRatesList"" on the IntentMediaNoPop video but shows If I click ""Select"" on the IntentMediaPop video.

IntentMedia.DISABLE_AUTORUN = false;
-- DISABLE_AUTORUN seems self explanatory, Shouldn't this be true?

I was able to reproduce this on Chrome, Safari and Opera both on Windows and Mac.

Let me know if you need more info.

Hi,

I'm trying to fix a few bugs on our site related to Intent Media Ads specially the one that opens a popup window.

What is happening is that the popup window is showing up inadvertently without us triggering it using the code IntentMedia.fill_exit_unit();

Do you know how that could happen?

Thanks.

"Share Trips created a new Exit Overlay placement (July 28) - email in reply to them. New placement was created without our knowledge.
~~~~~~~~
Hey Josh and Joe,
I saw the new exit overlay over on Monday and thought it would be a good time to reconnect about our API Guidelines and re-iterate that entirely new implementations and or placements require our approval. I am concerned that we're crossing a lot of wires and not moving the needle forward where we need to.

High Level:
1) Our API allows for experimentation in existing placements; however, we cannot automatically support entirely new placements on site (as you've done with the exit overlay). Any new placement requires our explicit approval (this is in our guidelines, which were amended to our contract); it is my understanding that this was already discussed a few months or so ago, but wanted to re-iterate. 

By exit overlay - I'm talking about this:
Inline image 1

Until we create an ad-ID and a new API call for this placement I think it makes sense to remove the exit overlay. Can you please confirm?

2) Our rationale for the above is two-fold:
a) New placements necessitate the creation of new ad ID's, and new API calls.  If we don't create a separate ad ID we can't examine separate results from the Exit Units versus other on-site placements. If we don't have the right data points we can't support product iteration and experimentation and track performance. 
b) Creating new ad ID's requires work on our end which impacts our resource utilization; resources on the PPA product are finite. If we don't have an organized queue of requests then we're liable to spend too much time spinning our wheels.  As an example - if we start working on the Exit Unit implementation this is going to push back our ability to support your request re. logos.

3) I also want to impress upon you how sensitive our advertiser relationships are.  While advertisers are supportive of the PPA product we need to be cognizant that the product is new to the market and we need to prove to advertisers that there is significant ROI. Any experimentation and or new implementation needs to be framed within the context of this advertiser sensitivity. Our goal is to grow our advertiser base, not frighten them. 

To further provide a bit of colour around this sensitivity - there has been a lot of advertiser blowback after ClickTripz and a hotel booking site showed meta-like ads ONLY when advertiser pricing was higher.  The incident outraged advertisers and we've been given a very short leash ever since. As a result there is a heightened sensitivity to where advertisements appear and how advertiser ads look (this is why we've been very cautious about logos). We're really trying to mitigate ANY risks or potential advertiser blowback and to be totally honest - we're going to be towing a really hard line with that.

4) If you think it would help - I am happy to set up a standing bi-weekly phone call (perhaps 10 minutes) where we can chat about some things you'd like to implement on site.  I can then work with Patrick to get these put into an organized queue that meshes with our resource capabilities. 

I hope that with having myself as the conduit for your strategic ideas (which are awesome - we love the creativity and are excited to measure results!) we can create and test an awesome meta hotel product.  

I know we're meeting August 5th - but would love to chat beforehand so we can get start prioritizing what needs to get done and mesh this with your new site design.

Are you available at all tomorrow to chat? My schedule is pretty flexible from about 10 AM EST onwards.

Talk soon,

3) Exit Overlay Options - discussed the possibility of adding search compare options to the Exit Overlay along with a PPA meta option.  The goal would be to create an overlay that has a PPA top placement with a SCA ad unit underneath.  Share Trips suggested that they would perhaps use Booking Buddy as the SCA part of the ad unit. I offered to provide them with our SCA API.
4) Standing Meeting Appointment - we now have a weekly 10 minute phone call to discuss share trip updates and new placements.

Action Items:
1) Update contract to include SCA API (Noreen)
2) Create new ad ID for PPA (Patrick) 
3) Unlock SCA API (Angus)",Jonathan Naymark,64266117,SalesAccount,,2014-07-31T16:52:16Z,20530673,ShareTrips,,,2014-07-31T16:52:16Z
"Logos were sent to Josh and Joe with logo rules:

These logos cannot be resized
These logos must be displayed directly onto a pure white background; no backgrounds with colors, even gray ones.
Logos colors cannot be changed or edited
Ad units must be designed such that all advertisers are displayed using logos, or no advertisers are displayed using logos.
Advertisers must be displayed with the same size logo (""large"", ""small"", or ""favicon"" size), although the actual pixel sizes of those logos tends to vary slightly 
Logo sizes cannot be mixed for an ad unit
Care must be taken to ensure the amount of space 'reserved' for each logo is equal, even though the actual sizes of logos may differ from advertiser-to-advertiser. We recommend 'reserving' a space as big as the largest advertiser's logo, and aligning the other advertiser logos within that space",Jonathan Naymark,64266117,SalesAccount,,2014-07-31T19:23:24Z,20535984,ShareTrips,,,2014-07-31T19:23:24Z
"ClicksCo Kick Off Meeting.
They are interested in the following placements:
1) iFC
2) XU
3) Rail

They are unsure if they would like to use the API or the Javascript implementation. 
Follow-ups:
1) discuss queue opportunities and timelines internally
2) Noreen to follow-up with PPA contract
3) Noreen to add cure period to contract - this is something we should extend to all API contracts

"Maria and Meng,

As of tomorrow you will be receiving a daily report from Intent Media.  The report will be sent automatically from reporting@intentmedia.com. The data file will include raw performance data for each of the ad placement up to the previous day. The report will be sent with the title: Intent Media Airtrade International AfT Placement Data Report as of Aug 13, 2014.  

The report will look like the attached CSV file. I know that you have been renamed Travix Travel, however, internally you are still in our system as Air Trade. If you would like me to change that I can.  Please let me know.

To support your ability to digest our reporting, a couple of notes:
Right now you have one placement on each page, a rail on Budget Air and a rail on Vayama; the Ad Unit ID for both is ""<Site Name> List Page""
The placement name is ""Rail""
Our report is addidtiver. Every day new rows are added to the report measuring results from the previous day, per site and per placement. Example:
Budget Air Flight List Page - will show the results of the right rail on Budget Air.
Vayama Flight List Page, will show the results of the right rail on Vayama.
Because our report is set up for multi-placement reporting there are also rows which measure ""total list page"" per site.  As of right now these metrics are identical to the placement rows; however, if we add additional placements (i.e. an intercard) then the Total Row will look at aggregate placement results (the exception is that page views are not additive).  
The above may seem confusing so please take a look and we can set up a call to walk you through it; it is super helpful once we get into it
I have also attached a separate file and pivot table to support your analytical capabilities
The pivot table analyzes the placement data and produces a daily report looking at  all of our metrics by day on aggregate across both sites and placements.  If you're looking for trending etc... this is helpful.
If you want to keep the pivot table updated you can:
Open the daily report
Copy the new data
Paste it into the top of the raw data
Refresh the pivot table
Maria I owe you another email with placement options, will send today.

Cheers,
Jonathan

- Michael has to review QBR again to see if numbers work (he hasn't)
- They are interested in property price ads on Hotel Wiz (the opportunity is probably too small for us)
- Any new contract would have to discuss commercials (AKA rev. share)
- Search Form for booking wiz is not a huge driver for them (although it is for us); they have to be sure that our Search Form can out-monetize current product, he's not sure it can.

"Share Trips is working with Booking Buddy on an Exit Unit Overlay.  
Some thoughts:
1) This new product lends credence that BB has an API - Exit Overlay looks like its custom work, can't see BB doing custom work for Share Trips as it is a tiny site although who knows.  
2) Exit Overlay is not multi-click (on Chrome). One click and it disappears. As with all BB products clicks still go directly to Booking Buddy's website where search results appear. 
3) Share Trips is also using the new BB Exit Unit - with the design that mimics ours. The new XU is multi-click and dynamic in terms of its search parameters.

The  Exit Overlay looks like this:

Hi Lynne,
 
It has been identified that the payments received on MoM basis are not matching with actual “Rev. Shr. $, Click Basis”

Let’s say for the month of Feb’14, the net revenue is $18,681.21 but there is no payment which reflects the exact amount.

We understand that you are releasing the payments according to the rev. share amount of the cash collected from the advertisers.
Appreciate if you could share the breakup which reflects MoM basis net revenue vs payment and leftover amount for each site.
It will give us clear information as in how much amount belongs to which site/month. I believe we will receive $18,681.21 even if the payments are split into two checks?
 
Thanks,

"8/22/2014 Internal Meeting on ShareTrips discussion: 

Noreen - more broadly can we not let a competitor test the PPA product at the same time as they test another product?

Messaging - our PPA product is very new; you’re not going to learn anything meaningful because we aren’t at scale, we don’t have an auction; in the short-term it's going to create confusion for advertisers and its not the right test to do because we’re not there. 

The only way that we can sell against Booking Buddy’s PPA product is developing the ancillary services - the auction, MVT, management of product.  Right now its not a fair apples to apples comparison because our CPC’s are below Booking Buddy’s/Trip Advisor

Messaging for Search Compare and Exit Units - We don’t have the solution today for what you want (i.e. a self service option). Our bar for implementing Exit Units for Search COmpare is $200,000.  ShareTrips is too small and we understand that an API is not the right solution for you either.

We would love to help you out and our products don’t meet your needs, we’d love your feedback and support - but we understand why you’re doing what you’re doing.  Right now we don’t have the solution for you, but hopefully we can work together in the near future.

Next Steps:
1) Noreen will follow up and connect
2) Jonathan will follow up every ",Jonathan Naymark,64266117,SalesAccount,,2014-08-22T20:26:23Z,21921901,ShareTrips,,,2014-08-22T20:26:23Z

Willing to add Tablet Exit Units - quick and EZ win for both parties on Farespotter and Low Fares
